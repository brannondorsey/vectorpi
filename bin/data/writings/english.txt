Look, words are like the air: they belong to everybody. Words are not
the problem; it's the tone, the context, where those words are aimed,
and in whose company they are uttered. Of course murderers and victims
use the same words, but I never read the words utopia, or beauty, or
tenderness in police descriptions. Do you know that the Argentinean
dictatorship burnt The Little Prince ? And I think they were right to
do so, not because I do not love The Little Prince , but because the
book is so full of tenderness that it would harm any dictatorship.
